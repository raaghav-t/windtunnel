plotApp step selection fix idea

Try moving the “move step forward” code to the beginning of the if statement. 

Try initializing the value of stepSelector to 0 (line 155).  (This didn’t work the first time I tried). 

Alternate idea: initialize the step as -2 and just remember to always start the step selector on 2. 

Alternate idea: use an if statement to make it do something different for the first data point (but this could slow down the code).
